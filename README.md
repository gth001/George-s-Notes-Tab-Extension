# George's Notes Tab Extension

An extension for Chromium browsers, which enables notetaking on new tabs. You no longer need a seperate text editor as a scratchpad.

Everything stays local, in browser cache. Notes persist across browser sessions. For privacy, nothing ever travels over the internet - this extension has zero internet connectivity.

Tab indenting is IDE style, in other words, the tab indent level is preserved on newlines.

Markdown and HTML links will render as links, and can be opened with right click.

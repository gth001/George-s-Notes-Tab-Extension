You no longer need a seperate text editor as a scratchpad.

Notes are automatically saved and persist across browser sessions and tabs.

Tab indenting is IDE style, in other words the tab indent level is preserved on newlines.

Markdown and HTML links will render as links, and can be opened with right click.

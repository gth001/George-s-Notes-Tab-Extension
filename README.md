It means you no longer need a seperate text editor open as a scratchpad.

Notes are automatically saved and persist across browser sessions and tabs.

Tab indenting is IDE style, in other words the tab indent level is preserved on newlines.

I haven't added it to Chrome/Edge stores yet since I made it for myself.
